Roei Herzig is a Research Scientist at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley. He works closely with Professor Trevor Darrell on developing Structured Physical Intelligence models, as part of his broader effort to advance Multimodal Foundation Models. He also collaborates with Professors Jitendra Malik, Deva Ramanan and Shankar Sastry on related efforts in computer vision, language, and robotics. His research focuses on integrating compositional and structured representations into Physical Intelligence systems to enhance robustness and generalization across modalities. His long-term research goal is to build physical intelligence systems that can perceive, reason, and adapt across robots and environments. Roei actively contributes to the research community through publications and peer review and is the recipient of the 2023 Dissertation Award for the best AI thesis in Israel, as well as the Israeli Excellence in Data Science Postdoctoral Fellowship.
